I am generally going to speak about the US economy. That's not because it is the only economy, it's just where I have the most information about. It is a really large and important economy. It's also one of the most successful economies of the 20th century, so not representative of the whole. Maybe I'll add other information later.

If you disagree with me, send a pull request. If you can improve my writing, send a pull request. If you have facts to add, send a pull request with sources. Thanks.
