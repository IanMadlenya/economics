##### Why write this?

I don’t make my money by tricking 19-year-olds who can borrow $80,000 *only if* it’s spent on a particular purpose. I think bilking young people is low class, even if it allows you to "be a thinker", whatever the fuck that means. [[michel chaoulli .. or similar]]

Some of my friends were smart enough to see the adults for what they were. I was not. I tended to be trusting of adults, especially professionals who smile and seem knowledgeable, smart, and not apparently against me.





##### What’s in it for me?

- Well, first of all, I like to shoot my mouth off online.
- Second, I’m pissed off that nobody did this for me.
- Third, I may end up meeting a client if this is shared widely enough. (You won’t find out who I am through this handle, and I never try to make money directly by blogging. It’s simply a self-promotion mechanism which can lead to real work. ((By the way, I think Seth Godin is a creep. Should write that in the main body.))
- Finally, it’s uncomfortable for me to live in a world where Peter Thiel, Paul Graham, Ray Kurzweil, Robert Reich, Cato Institute, LSE, HBR, and the New York Times are ruining culture, making people stupider and [suckier](https://www.quora.com/What-is-going-to-be-the-next-big-thing-in-the-next-5-10-years "Awful."). Sometimes I walk around on the internet and feel like I have no home in conversation. Well, PG can write opinion pieces and so can I. If I’m really successful in using my facts to convince you of my esthetics, then I’ll be more likely to get into a comfortable conversation at a bar or on twitter, and less likely to encounter creepy creeps.
