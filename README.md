# economics

Facts I think "everyone should know". I'll try to keep it short and theory-free. That said, this is an _opinionated_ selection of facts. It will be too obvious for some but hopefully not too advanced for anyone. This is what I wish someone would have told me X years ago.


I am generally going to speak about the US economy. That's not because it is the only economy, it's just where I have the most information about. It is a really large and important economy. It's also one of the most successful economies of the 20th century, so not representative of the whole. Maybe I'll add other information later.

## capitalism & communism

Libertarians love to cite the following successes of capitalism:

However let's not stop there. A high average growth rate and high wealth levels aren't everything.






#### Pay

Competitive labor markets are meant to empower workers exactly when employers are forced to pay more. For example:


www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2015/jul/25/nail-salons-new-york-times-got-wrong
> My wife has learned that if she is unable to assure her employees that they will earn a total of at least $100 a day, nobody will work for her.

![capitalism vs communism](http://36.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzdx1tJidd1qc38e9o2_1280.png)

Because of the stark differences between North & South Korea, East & West Germany, Taiwan & 大陆, and pre/post Deng Xiaoping's "opening" of China, you cannot argue that capitalism does not create greater wealth than communism.

Capitalism created wealth in the 20th century. Communism created less and they had access to the same technology. Greater wealth means an easier and more comfortable life. So there is something that we want about capitalism. But what exactly is it? And how much of the bad stuff can we get rid of?





###### "enhanced" capitalism

Long before the crisis of 2008, people have wanted a kinder, gentler capitalism. Does 

You don't need to adopt ad-hoc views about government versus corporate management. There might be some differences between the people who go into one versus the other, but the stereotypes about college sophomore hippies who read Saul Alinsky versus the red-blooded business students who misunderstand Gordon Gekko's purpose in _Wall Street_ (www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArS16ZyOxLQ) ---- are lazy, insufficient guides to characterise government vs business. Both are complex organisations. Both employ lazy risk-haters. Both require layers of communication and compromise. Both work with other people's money. Businessmen often serve on city councils. Etc.

A simpler reason that lawmakers shouldn't delve into the details is that it's too hard. Go to a few city council meetings wherever you live. Ask yourself if you are an expert on par with interested parties in:

- how to insulate a home
- the best kind of fire alarms
- how to design roads safely
- how to encourage both positive & negative feedback from the people you serve when you make the wrong call
- how to 


It ain't easy or fun. And people who critique politicians out of hand for being stupid are lazy non-thinkers. Inform yourself or shut up; you have the internet, so you have no excuse.

I will list several ways that various layers of US federalist government intelligently avoid making decisions they are not equipped to make. The desire to devolve decisions is in my opinion a sign of great intelligence on the part of federal and state lawmakers.

I'll give some examples below.

## growth & history

http://www.theworldeconomy.org/

> Over the past millennium, world population rose 22–fold. Per capita income increased 13–fold, world GDP nearly 300–fold. This contrasts sharply with the preceding millennium, when world population grew by only a sixth, and there was no advance in per capita income.

> From the year 1000 to 1820 the advance in per capita income was a slow crawl — the world average rose about 50 per cent. Most of the growth went to accommodate a fourfold increase in population.

> Since 1820, world development has been much more dynamic. Per capita income rose more than eightfold, population more than fivefold.

> Per capita income growth is not the only indicator of welfare. Over the long run, there has been a dramatic increase in life expectation. In the year 1000, the average infant could expect to live about 24 years. A third would die in the first year of life, hunger and epidemic disease would ravage the survivors. There was an almost imperceptible rise up to 1820, mainly in Western Europe. Most of the improvement has occurred since then. Now the average infant can expect to survive 66 years.

> The growth process was uneven in space as well as time. The rise in life expectation and income has been most rapid in Western Europe, North America, Australasia and Japan. By 1820, this group had forged ahead to an income level twice that in the rest of the world. By 1998, the gap was 7:1. Between the United States and Africa the gap is now 20:1. This gap is still widening. Divergence is dominant but not inexorable. In the past half century, resurgent Asian countries have demonstrated that an important degree of catch–up is feasible. Nevertheless world economic growth has slowed substantially since 1973, and the Asian advance has been offset by stagnation or retrogression elsewhere.

## banking

Does finance serve any useful purpose? The first way to argue it does is to think about home loans.



(The bank will repossess your house if you get too far behind on your mortgage. However they will likely take a loss so it is bad for both parties. Otherwise you could expect that banks would loan to whomever. If they could resell the house at face then a mortgage would involve no risk to them so they would just do it as much as possible. [[student loans tkacik]]







Over time consumer credit has expanded into car loans and credit-card loans. [[[frb research on cc debt]]]

- Tkacik student loans







Any way you slice it, the banking business is about borrowing cheap and lending dear. The economic question is how that goal set affects the rest of us.








### repo markets

Carolyn Sissoko emphasises that lenders prefer to loan against collateral. If you don't pay them back then they get to take your thing.

Treasury bills are considered so secure that they make good collateral. I get money today while you hold my T-bill. If I don't pay you back with interest then you already have my T-bill and don't need to come looking for me. [^ Believe me --- if you've never run a business --- chasing customers down for money _they already owe you_ --- you've already "made the sale" and done the work --- is a huge pain in the ass and a feature of every business. That is why `accounts receivable` is a major accounting category. People try to wriggle out of paying, for real.]



You'll need to think through the [mechanics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1olbQ4LyfFA) a few times before you get it.

- libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2011/04/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-the-tri-party-repo-market-but-didnt-know-to-ask.html
- geithner

According to Tim Geithner's book _Stress Test_, repo is the main way that hedge funds financed trades. The problem with getting financing from the money markets is that, since the terms change every day, you can't count on them too much. Big companies need a department that does nothing but plan and predict treasury financing. In the crisis of 2008 the money markets just stopped offering companies money. Imagine that you are used to borrowing in ranges like 3, 4, or 5 percent and then one day the market was offering 500 percent at best. If your business runs on debt (most public companies do --- see [[LBO]], requires a lender to go through the basic operations of paying your vendors and employees, shipping your packages and            _____. Maybe for a while you can put people off. But what if the money markets aren't back next week? next month?


This seems like an important feature of today's economic, capitalistic setup. Because of specialisation most companies rely on a lot of other companies to do necessary parts of their business for them. In fact vertical integration is illegal [^ for other reasons]. Imagine that you ran an auto body shop and one day all the people who supply you with paint are gone. You could only serve the customers with the paint you had left. Maybe you talk them into getting a weird color that's "close"? And then what do you do when the paint suppliers are still gone a month later? Do you try to figure out how to make auto paints yourself? This is just one example of [[general equilibrium]] problems: the disappearance of auto-paint suppliers would cause a ripple effect.

[^ Microsoft is an exception [[link]] ]








## bonds

Every year $__ trillion worth of bonds change hands globally.






### future money

![future money](future money.png)


That is the cost of future money. For example on `Sys.Date() == 2015-07-31` the yield on 1-year Treasury notes is `0.36%`, which means that $100 will become $100.36 and $10,000 will become $10,036 in one year's time. If you spent $10,000 on 1-years that day you would receive $10,036 in one year's time.


I am being inaccurate by calling it "future money" but it's close enough.



or http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds has some non-US bonds.













Here is how that curve has moved over time:

Who benefits the most from tax breaks? Those who pay the highest tax rate. So the federal government rewards the rich if they invest in communities and localities, without asking legislators to pick winners or do due diligence.

![income distribution](http://visualeconsite.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2005_income_distribution.gif)

due to Catherine Mulbrandon: http://visualizingeconomics.com/blog/2006/11/05/2005-us-income-distribution

Notice that:
1. not only do half of the households get by on less than $40k / year, there arearound just a ton of people who (combined, if multiple people work in the home) earn $20k or $30k.
2. the rich live in their own world [^ I think you would need a `log(log($))` scale to fit the rich.]

People who index around $100k or complain about how there exist others who make more money than they do (doctors, corporate lawyers, investment bankers, currency traders, whatever) are living in a bubble. Normal Americans make $20k or $30k. (If you assume full-time work = 50 weeks × 40 hours/week = 2000 hours/year, then that would be $10/hour – $15/hour. Normal.)


There are some reasons the $0/year households aren't dead: they might be retired and living off of savings, or they might have negative business income for the year but generally be rich. [[mpls fed]]

Anyway. It's the $10/hr - $15/hr number that we should be interested in increasing. In a capitalist world that means empowering those people. Their productivity needs to go up and/or they need to capture more of what they already produce.

Obviously: marry someone with two million dollars. The paperwork for marriage is faster than insurance settlements, because insurance companies will always battle you in court to not give you the money. [[quote]]




You can't sideline inheritance 

It's a fundamental human right to be able to do what you want with your own money. (That's what "your money" is, right?) But actually, no. You can't hire a hitman, nor should you be able to. And the government steps in to take taxes

###### general equilibrium

You can probably imagine what would happen if small economic changes were made in your workplace, your friends' lives, your community. What would you do with a 5% raise?

But what if the minimum wage were multiplied by ten? What if not only you got a million dollars, but so did everyone on your street? Big changes are harder to think about. The reaction to the initial "stimulus" (let's say it's a law) might become really important too.





###### life goals

Guru jerks will tell you that you should become rich enough to live off interest. This doesn't make sense for a variety of reasons, for example the obvious that if you can earn $20,000/year as a 2% coupon. Or that you risk spoiling your kids [[link]]. Or that work is not really that bad. But anyway it's all part of a pervasive ideology that wants to venerate wealth and capitalist achievement. Perhaps not surprising when buildings and chairs are named after capitalist donors rather than those who excelled in a field of human endeavour.

It's the kind of thing that makes sense if you think about it for a minute, but not if you think about it for a long time.

2. Renaissance job postings for tax advisors. Again, tax savings are risk-free basis points.

I don't want to waste too much time lampooning economists because I could go on forever about that and it's probably better to just point to the stuff you _should_ read, rather than waste time engaging with the un-serious. I'll just point out that growth in the median (middle) purchasing power is a _proxy_ for an easier, better life for "people", but then again so is the purchasing power of the lowest person. It's not even possible to rank-order these things----but my preferred measure is the power, freedom, and quality-of-life of "the least among you". We can at least get closer by looking at the 10th-percentile wage instead of the 50th-percentile.
