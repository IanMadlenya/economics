Facts I think "everyone should know". I'll try to keep it short and theory-free. That said, this is an _opinionated_ selection of facts. It will be too obvious for some but hopefully not too advanced for anyone. This is what I wish someone would have told me X years ago. Alternately, if I were teaching a course in economics 101, this is what I would build a course around. This is (a very imperfect and incomplete draft of) what I think would serve the students' rather than the teachers' interests.

Hey, pretty nice. Wealth isn't everything (it's not love or art or fun), but it makes life nicer. And now there's more total wealth? Sweet. How did that happen? And how do we make it happen? And how do _I_ make it happen to _me_?

# Data and acronyms

#### GDP and PPP

There are some technical definitions to GNP versus GDP which you should look up some day. 


##### Linkage

Everyone's expense is someone else's income. So economics is all about linkages. In a closed system, if there were $100 billion of spending then that would imply $100 billion of output. However things are more complicated since "spending" could be repairing depreciated capital (a recurring cost of roughly 10% per year --- source: Piketty) or investing in new projects that might not go anywhere. It is also complicated by residence and nationality.

#### ECI, CPI, PPP

Although it might not make sense on the basis of individual transactions at constantly adjusting prices, deals struck for incommensurable goods [^no two houses are alike, for example] on ad-hoc terms, for job purpose of statistics advanced nations try to compute "general price levels". This is a hairy business but that is the only way you can get one summary number out of a zillion transactions ((((how many?)))) that take place every year.


billion prices project

###### PPP

There is also a relatively unique price level at which currencies can be exchanged with each other. For example at `abcefg` the conversion between USD and JPY is 124¥:1USD. It did this over the last year:

![spot market](USD.JPY.png)

That price level is not the right conversion to use to compare "general standards of living". Again this is not really a well defined concept because banh mi is better in Viet Nam by construction than anywhere else, and French food is better than English by culture. Houses in the South of France are more regulated in what you can and can't do with them. Etc. Nowhere is the same. But statisticians do at least try to make a better inter-country comparison than just using the spot rate. They compile Purchasing Power Parity numbers every few years which are meant to be used to make better cross-country comparisons. Read about it some time.

> About $54 million from a tax-exempt bond helped cover a legal judgment awarded to African-Americans who were denied a chance to become firefighters by a 1990s entrance exam that favored white applicants. An additional $8 million in tax-exempt bond money went to pay legal fees related to the case, records show.

Because of the stark differences between North & South Korea, East & West Germany, Taiwan & 大陆, and pre/post Deng Xiaoping's "opening" of China, you cannot argue that capitalism does not create greater wealth than communism.

Capitalism created wealth in the 20th century. Communism created less and they had access to the same technology. Greater wealth means an easier and more comfortable life. So there is something that we want about capitalism. But what exactly is it? And how much of the bad stuff can we get rid of?

You don't need to adopt ad-hoc views about government versus corporate management.

Both are complex organisations. Both employ lazy risk-haters. Both require layers of communication and compromise. Both work with other people's money. Businessmen often serve on city councils. Etc.

A simpler reason that lawmakers shouldn't delve into the details is that it's too hard. Go to a few city council meetings wherever you live. Ask yourself if you are an expert on par with interested parties in:

- how to insulate a home
- the best kind of fire alarms
- how to design roads safely
- how to encourage both positive & negative feedback from the people you serve when you make the wrong call

# growth & history

http://www.theworldeconomy.org/

> Over the past millennium, world population rose 22–fold. Per capita income increased 13–fold, world GDP nearly 300–fold. This contrasts sharply with the preceding millennium, when world population grew by only a sixth, and there was no advance in per capita income.

> From the year 1000 to 1820 the advance in per capita income was a slow crawl — the world average rose about 50 per cent. Most of the growth went to accommodate a fourfold increase in population.

> Since 1820, world development has been much more dynamic. Per capita income rose more than eightfold, population more than fivefold.

> Per capita income growth is not the only indicator of welfare. Over the long run, there has been a dramatic increase in life expectation. In the year 1000, the average infant could expect to live about 24 years. A third would die in the first year of life, hunger and epidemic disease would ravage the survivors. There was an almost imperceptible rise up to 1820, mainly in Western Europe. Most of the improvement has occurred since then. Now the average infant can expect to survive 66 years.

> The growth process was uneven in space as well as time. The rise in life expectation and income has been most rapid in Western Europe, North America, Australasia and Japan. By 1820, this group had forged ahead to an income level twice that in the rest of the world. By 1998, the gap was 7:1. Between the United States and Africa the gap is now 20:1. This gap is still widening. Divergence is dominant but not inexorable. In the past half century, resurgent Asian countries have demonstrated that an important degree of catch–up is feasible. Nevertheless world economic growth has slowed substantially since 1973, and the Asian advance has been offset by stagnation or retrogression elsewhere.

### Mastery of Energy

http://web.mit.edu/lienhard/www/ahtt.html

[[[figures]]]

> The life forms on our planet have necessarily evolved to match the
magnitude of these energy flows. But while “natural man” is in balance
with these heat flows, “technological man”1 has used his mind, his back,
and his will to harness and control energy flows that are far more intense
than those we experience naturally. To emphasize this point we suggest
that the reader make an experiment.


> Experiment 1.1
Generate as much power as you can, in some way that permits you to
measure your own work output. You might lift a weight, or run your own
weight up a stairwell, against a stopwatch. Express the result in watts (W).
Perhaps you might collect the results in your class. They should generally
be less than 1 kW or even 1 horsepower (746 W). How much less might
be surprising.

> Thus, when we do so small a thing as turning on a 150 W light bulb,
we are manipulating a quantity of energy substantially greater than a
human being could produce in sustained effort. The power consumed
by an oven, toaster, or hot water heater is an order of magnitude beyond
our capacity. The power consumed by an automobile can easily be three
orders of magnitude greater. If all the people in the United States worked
continuously like galley slaves, they could barely equal the output of even
a single city power plant.
Our voracious appetite for energy has steadily driven the intensity
of actual heat transfer processes upward until they are far greater than
those normally involved with life forms on earth. Until the middle of the
thirteenth century, the energy we use was drawn indirectly from the sun
1
Some anthropologists think that the term Homo technologicus (technological man)
serves to define human beings, as apart from animals, better than the older term Homo
sapiens (man, the wise). We may not be as much wiser than the animals as we think we
are, but only we do serious sustained tool making.


> using comparatively gentle processes — animal power, wind and water
power, and the combustion of wood. Then population growth and defor-
estation drove the English to using coal. By the end of the seventeenth
century, England had almost completely converted to coal in place of
wood. At the turn of the eighteenth century, the first commercial steam
engines were developed, and that set the stage for enormously increased
consumption of coal. Europe and America followed England in these
developments.
The development of fossil energy sources has been a bit like Jules
Verne’s description in Around the World in Eighty Days in which, to win
a race, a crew burns the inside of a ship to power the steam engine. The
combustion of nonrenewable fossil energy sources (and, more recently,
the fission of uranium) has led to remarkably intense energy releases in
power-generating equipment. The energy transferred as heat in a nuclear
reactor is on the order of one million watts per square meter.

So one way to think about then versus now is that the industrial revolution gave us power generation and power consumption.

Because the extra efficiency will lower prices. Lower prices of transport or home/business/farm/industrial electricity will increase usage because of economics. So we can't necessarily solve pollution by better engineering, or at least people will work against us. On the other hand we could not rely on our intelligence to invent superior ways of doing stuff and simply invert the problem: tax electricity and you can reduce usage, without having to invent anything. This has the obvious downside that then you don't get to have as much electricity as you wanted.]]]]

# banking

Does finance serve any useful purpose? The first way to argue it does is to think about home loans.



(The bank will repossess your house if you get too far behind on your mortgage. However they will likely take a loss so it is bad for both parties. Otherwise you could expect that banks would loan to whomever. If they could resell the house at face then a mortgage would involve no risk to them so they would just do it as much as possible. [[student loans tkacik]]







Over time consumer credit has expanded into car loans and credit-card loans. [[[frb research on cc debt]]]

Any way you slice it, the banking business is about borrowing cheap and lending dear. The economic question is how that goal set affects the rest of us.








## repo markets

Carolyn Sissoko emphasises that lenders prefer to loan against collateral. If you don't pay them back then they get to take your thing.

Treasury bills are considered so secure that they make good collateral. I get money today while you hold my T-bill. If I don't pay you back with interest then you already have my T-bill and don't need to come looking for me. [^ Believe me --- if you've never run a business --- chasing customers down for money _they already owe you_ --- you've already "made the sale" and done the work --- is a huge pain in the ass and a feature of every business. That is why `accounts receivable` is a major accounting category. People try to wriggle out of paying, for real.]



You'll need to think through the [mechanics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1olbQ4LyfFA) a few times before you get it.

- libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2011/04/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-the-tri-party-repo-market-but-didnt-know-to-ask.html
- geithner

According to Tim Geithner's book _Stress Test_, repo is the main way that hedge funds financed trades. The problem with getting financing from the money markets is that, since the terms change every day, you can't count on them too much. Big companies need a department that does nothing but plan and predict treasury financing. In the crisis of 2008 the money markets just stopped offering companies money. Imagine that you are used to borrowing in ranges like 3, 4, or 5 percent and then one day the market was offering 500 percent at best. If your business runs on debt (most public companies do --- see [[LBO]], requires a lender to go through the basic operations of paying your vendors and employees, shipping your packages and            _____. Maybe for a while you can put people off. But what if the money markets aren't back next week? next month?


This seems like an important feature of today's economic, capitalistic setup. Because of specialisation most companies rely on a lot of other companies to do necessary parts of their business for them. In fact vertical integration is illegal [^ for other reasons]. Imagine that you ran an auto body shop and one day all the people who supply you with paint are gone. You could only serve the customers with the paint you had left. Maybe you talk them into getting a weird color that's "close"? And then what do you do when the paint suppliers are still gone a month later? Do you try to figure out how to make auto paints yourself? This is just one example of [[general equilibrium]] problems: the disappearance of auto-paint suppliers would cause a ripple effect.

(A couple years ago business academics wrote papers about "hoarding cash" ... not coincidentally journalists in major newspapers were talking about "hoarding cash" ... not coincidentally people and their friends were losing theri jobs, fewer people were hiring, and corporate profits were high. Hence, "stop hoarding cash, you big bad corporations".)

# bonds

Every year $__ trillion worth of bonds change hands globally.

For comparison the sum total value of all public companies [^ NB: calculating the price based on the marginal is not really correct because as you tried to sell all of the company's shares, the price might change.] is ~~. And ____ changes hands each year.


###### capital structure

Companies are owned by shareholders (equity, which is traded in the New York Stock Exchange [[[pic]]], Frankfurt, ....) 


Some shareholders are mutual funds, pensions, or ETF's. In other words groups that have pooled their money together to own fractions of many companies [^and perhaps own fractions of other things, like forests [[[link]]] or future claims on [[[cow types /// wheat types]]] --- the other things might trade in a different location like Chicago or Kansas City.]




Companies also borrow money. Borrowing = − debt = bonds. Equity = ownership = shares &ne; bonds. Corporate earnings go first to bondholders 





##### sameness and securitisation

In order to bring things to a market they need to be similar. Commodity exchanges for example have a lot of rules about what the delivered product needs to be.


[[[brahmin cows]]]]

[[[gold delivery ]]]


[[[fcoj history ... https://www.theice.com/publicdocs/ICE_FCOJ_Brochure.pdf ... http://www.ultimatecitrus.com/pdf/fcoj.pdf ... brown



Think about rice. Only if the rices are all equivalated somehow can they be mixed together and sold en masse. If they can be mixed together then third-parties can trade it even if they don't want or make rice.

For example wheat traders do not want to take delivery, they simply "make a market" for wheat. Pit traders would aggressively buy and sell slips of paper worth ____ bushels of wheat to each other throughout the day, speculating on the ultimate value at delivery.

With things like steel people go to a lot of cost and might actually destroy value, to bring the steel to market. Say you have an awesome steel sculpture. If you can't find someone who agrees it is awesome and sell it to them and deliver it to them, you might melt it down so that its only value is as a commodity.





###### RMBS's

It's this drive to make things exchangeable at a unified trading point that makes it so hard to get a mortgage if you're self-employed. Maybe it is or isn't true that a W-2 job is more stable than the higher-paying 1099 one you have. What is sold on (in packets of 10,000 mortgages at a time [[[link]]) and traded to third-party financial institutions is a conforming mortgage.

Local banks don't need to, themselves, hold enough money to buy every house in town. If they originate conforming mortgages and sell them on to people who *do* have boatloads of money, then they have a repeatable, scalable, fee-based business. Each conforming mortgage is so many dollars. It's a uniform process like an assembly line. It doesn't mean your job isn't valid, just that people who don't fit in the box are harder to pack together and sell as a conforming packet of 10,000.

######Fairness

Is it unfair of them not to loan you money? If I were a conservative I would say it's their prerogative and nobody owes you a loan, however the US has laws that make certain businesses to some extent public institutions. Even if you want to rent a room in your home you are not allowed to discriminate on certain bases. [[[craigslist -- fair housing]]]

Some people like to pretend fairness isn't part of it but in a lawful society it is. We also regulate exchanges and securities offerings. You can't just do whatever you want, sort of like how you can't hire a hit man or tell certain kinds of lies with certain kinds of products. (For example you can lie about supplements all you want, but not about food or drugs.)

In general the law balances freedom with fairness. Capitalism as we know it exists only within a system of laws, and capitalism as we know it has never arisen outside a system of laws. It would be inconceivable to make the kind of money Warren Buffett has made without policies to protect fairly earned wealth. Imagine two boys playing by themselves with no adults around. They make a bet for five dollars. The one who loses refuses to pay and they punch each other. No money is exchanged. This is what I think would happen instead of a carefully regulated system of trust that is necessary for the function of exchanges like the CME. [[[[link to CME stuff




###### labour markets are not markets

If labour markets were like the CME, then you would be able to buy and sell large packs of "work units", let's say 10,000 hours per contract. It would not have to be "generic work". We don't trade "generic cows" or "generic oil" or "generic steel" either. 


For this reason I do not believe "the labour market" is a market in the usual sense of the word.


I've seen market-like things in labour. For example day-labourers will all show up at a an appointed place at 5 in the morning and then scramble for work as whoever that wants "generic manual labour" and can pay cash same-day picks them up in a truck and drives off to the job site. But I think as skills diversify even a little [[[free grou picyture]]] it stops working this way. If you're a flooring expert or an electrician or a journeyman anything, there ceases to be a gathering-market and it starts to look more like the familiar office-work pattern of sending résumés / curriculum vit&aelig; and establishing long-term relationships.

###### retail is not a market

Stores in the United States post an offer and you cannot haggle it. Bix box stores contain loads of goods from just one company. Their suppliers may compete with each other but at the consumer end once you're inside Wal Mart you are probably going to buy most of your stuff there. You would have to hoof it across town and you can't see what's in the other store so might as well go with the W. [^ This is a point where I think rationalistic economist models are irrelevant. Rational purchasing may happen over the long run ---- whatever that means --- or it may happen at the supplier level where Wal-Mart squeezes greater profits by muscling against its suppliers. However that is in the back end not at the direct consumer end.]

Stores are also "designed, not emergent". The ladies with the spices can sit wherever they want and readjust throughout the day. The buyer can saunter around. Grocery stores are the complete opposite, they have experts deciding "from the top down" [^fugly 90's speak] what to put next to each other on the shelves.

What's the difference between Folgers instant coffee and Starbucks instant coffee? Starbucks comes in a tiny packet (not a large can), it's decorated by the favourite small-daily-luxury brand of the median culture, and it's not called “instant coffee”. “Instant” is like pre-sliced bread: it speaks to the atomic-age not to the post-industrial organic age.

## future money

![future money](future money.png)


That is the cost of future money. For example on `Sys.Date() == 2015-07-31` the yield on 1-year Treasury notes is `0.36%`, which means that $100 will become $100.36 and $10,000 will become $10,036 in one year's time. If you spent $10,000 on 1-years that day you would receive $10,036 in one year's time.


I am being inaccurate by calling it "future money" but it's close enough.

# rich & poor




![income distribution](http://visualeconsite.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2005_income_distribution.gif)

due to Catherine Mulbrandon: http://visualizingeconomics.com/blog/2006/11/05/2005-us-income-distribution

Notice that:
1. not only do half of the households get by on less than $40k / year, there arearound just a ton of people who (combined, if multiple people work in the home) earn $20k or $30k.
2. the rich live in their own world [^ I think you would need a `log(log($))` scale to fit the rich.]

People who index around $100k or complain about how there exist others who make more money than they do (doctors, corporate lawyers, investment bankers, currency traders, whatever) are living in a bubble. Normal Americans make $20k or $30k. (If you assume full-time work = 50 weeks × 40 hours/week = 2000 hours/year, then that would be $10/hour – $15/hour. Normal.)


There are some reasons the $0/year households aren't dead: they might be retired and living off of savings, or they might have negative business income for the year but generally be rich. [[mpls fed]]

Anyway. It's the $10/hr - $15/hr number that we should be interested in increasing. In a capitalist world that means empowering those people. Their productivity needs to go up and/or they need to capture more of what they already produce.

# The corporate landscape

People get the things they need and want in life from companies. They earn the paper to buy these things from working at one or a few companies. We have chosen capitalism as the way that things will get done.

I saw an ad for SportsClips in Entrepreneur magazine one time (it's a shitty magazine but for some reason cowork spaces like to stock it. I guess it makes them look like everybody else?)



##### Specialty magazines

- Regional Banker magazine



Since as a media owner your job is actually to sell ads, why not just start with a group of people you want to advertise to? Source some shitty articles from shitty writers that are vaguely on topic, figure out how to do glossy printing, and 


#### Government bids

Every customer is different and so is the government. Since governments have the power to tax and since they pool the resources of a community, they often have a lot of money. And they might not be very smart at spending it.

Witness DoD contracts

###### Gyms

If you want to sell your gym it will be valued proportional to how many credit cards you have permission to bill each month.

###### Recurring revenues

Recurring revenues are really important to businesses but don't fit the theory models. Serious problem with theory in my opinion.

This story demonstrated to a lot of people that advertising is dumb money. At that point they were paying for page views, so he just made the site worse by giving it more page views.

† Corporations aren't here to serve you the best products that make you happy[^ Although this has become the conventional wisdom of the educated class, because you know, Adam Smith or something. Markets in everything!], they are just sometimes forced to do that through rigorous competition. However there is unbridled competition in websites and PoF was still providing a definitively inferior product to customers yet making more money off of it.

That may have changed now, I think ad measurement is different but ad buyers still have a "monthly spend" as in --- I'm the boss, I delegated to you that you need to _find ways to spend **at least** this amount_ each month, be creative if necessary.[^ But you know, let's still teach Edgeworth boxes because, um. Guess the professors aren't there to serve your interests either? Bingo! Not that they're mean, I think they just have other priorities besides making the prefect truthful relevant class, when it requires fighting against the grain and is not where their bread is buttered.

######EITC

Milton Friedman's alternative to the minimum wage is to pay low wage workers instead of taxing them. Even though he was a conservative, Friedman never thought the negative tax on low-paid workers was high enough during his lifetime.

Software companies aren't "more ethical" than fast food companies because their employees happen to be white collar. Actually it's maybe the other way around, since providing employment to the least powerful is a social good. Anyway, however you slice it, poverty is everyone's problem, so everyone should contribute.

A negative tax has the further upside that it increases tax-filing rates, and the further downside that you don't want your income to come all at once during the year, especially if you are scraping by.

You can probably imagine what would happen if small economic changes were made in your workplace, your friends' lives, your community. What would you do with a 5% raise?

But what if the minimum wage were multiplied by ten? What if not only you got a million dollars, but so did everyone on your street? Big changes are harder to think about. The reaction to the initial "stimulus" (let's say it's a law) might become really important too.





##### life goals

Guru jerks will tell you that you should become rich enough to live off interest. This doesn't make sense for a variety of reasons, for example the obvious that if you can earn $20,000/year as a 2% coupon. Or that you risk spoiling your kids [[link]]. Or that work is not really that bad. But anyway it's all part of a pervasive ideology that wants to venerate wealth and capitalist achievement. Perhaps not surprising when buildings and chairs are named after capitalist donors rather than those who excelled in a field of human endeavour.

It's the kind of thing that makes sense if you think about it for a minute, but not if you think about it for a long time.

This is a hedge fund whose blowup had systemic consequences.

2. Renaissance job postings for tax advisors. Again, tax savings are risk-free basis points.

##### median wage growth vs wage growth for _me_

I don't want to waste too much time lampooning economists because I could go on forever about that and it's probably better to just point to the stuff you _should_ read, rather than waste time engaging with the un-serious. I'll just point out that growth in the median (middle) purchasing power is a _proxy_ for an easier, better life for "people", but then again so is the purchasing power of the lowest person. It's not even possible to rank-order these things----but my preferred measure is the power, freedom, and quality-of-life of "the least among you". We can at least get closer by looking at the 10th-percentile wage instead of the 50th-percentile.
