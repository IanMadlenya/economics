> I have no accurate knowledge of my age,
never having seen any authentic record containing it. By far the larger part
of the slaves know as little of their ages as horses know of theirs, and it
is the wish of most masters within my knowledge to keep their slaves thus
ignorant. I do not remember to have ever met a slave who could tell of his
birthday. They seldom come nearer to it than planting-time, harvest-time,
cherry-time, spring-time, or fall-time. A want of information concerning my
own was a source of unhappiness to me even during childhood. The white
children could tell their ages. I could not tell why I ought to be deprived
of the same privilege. I was not allowed to make any inquiries of my master
concerning it. He deemed all such inquiries on the part of a slave improper
and impertinent, and evidence of a restless spirit. â€•Frederick Douglass, self-taught reader and writer
